# C++ Learning Journey

This repository contains my C++ learning progress, including exercises, notes, and mini-projects.

## Learning Resource
The exercises in this repository are initially from the book:
**[Modern C++ for Absolute Beginners](https://github.com/Mohammed-3tef/Computer_Science_Books/blob/main/Modern%20C%2B%2B%20For%20Absolute%20Beginners.pdf)**.

As I progress, I may add my own projects and custom exercises.

## Topics Covered
- Basic Syntax
- Variables and Data Types
- Input/Output (cin, cout)
- Control Flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and Scope
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Notes
This repository is for practice purposes only.
